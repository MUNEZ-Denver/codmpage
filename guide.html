            <strong>Hardpoint (Elite | 150 Points)</strong> Objective-based mode where teams fight to control rotating hardpoint zones on the map. Staying inside the zone earns points, so rotate early and defend with teammates. First team to reach the score limit wins.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Search & Destroy (Elite | 8 Rounds)</strong> Tactical mode where players have only one life each round. Teams must plant or defend the bomb, making teamwork and careful movement important to win rounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Frontline (Elite | 60 Points)</strong> Similar to Team Deathmatch, but players respawn at their base. Protect your spawn and push carefully to avoid enemy control.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Team Deathmatch (Elite | 50 Points)</strong> Classic mode where teams race to reach the kill limit first. Great for beginners to practice aiming, movement, and weapon control.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Beginner Tips:</strong> Adjust controls and sensitivity, use cover in fights, reload safely, and move with teammates. Learning maps and practicing aim regularly will quickly improve gameplay.
