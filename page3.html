                The "TOURNAMENT" emblem with a season label (S15 in this case).
                This represents the current tournament season.
                <br><br>
                Below the emblem, it says "TOURNAMENT OPENS IN: 0 0 0" – usually,
                this is a countdown timer until the next tournament opens. In this
                screenshot, it’s already available (countdown finished).
                <br><br>
                Shows special rewards (like frames, skins, camos, and tokens) that
                can be earned by participating in tournaments. These rewards are
                exclusive and not normally found in regular modes.

        <div class="card">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MUNEZ-Denver/codmpage/main/suit.jfif" alt="Gundam Event" class="event-img">
            <p>
                A large, detailed Gundam mobile suit is prominently displayed.
                <br><br>
                Game Hub Elements: Several options are presented around the Gundam,
                including Gundam Hub, Task, Leaderboard, Gundam Battle Pass, Mini
                Gundam Strike, Gundam Team Deathmatch, and Gundam Gallery.
                <br><br>
                Setting: The background features a space scene with planets,
                asteroids, and other spacecraft, reinforcing the Gundam theme.
                <br><br>
                Overall Impression: The image gives the impression of a visually
                rich and engaging Gundam event, with various modes and features
                accessible from the central hub.
